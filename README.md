## Simple Skaffold Nginx

This is basic skaffold to develop app with kubernetest environment.


Run
```
skaffold dev
```


I made the `skaffold.yaml` file. But if you create from scratch you must initial the skaffold

```
skaffold init
```

That will be generate `skaffold.yaml` and detect you manifest kubernetes on working directory
